It discusses coordinating any INS contact with Staff C/ICB and WH, due to the sensitivity of HIDALGO's potential assignments, and suggests that INS submit questions through the Agency to avoid jeopardizing his future use. The memo also addresses a security breach by HIDALGO's father, who disclosed his Agency employment to an INS inspector.",
