  "summary": "This cable discusses intelligence regarding a potential uprising in Cuba. It suggests that while information points to a planned revolt, there's a strong possibility it's a deception or provocation operation by Castro's forces. Various exile groups are mentioned, and their involvement is investigated, with most denying knowledge of the planned uprising. The cable concludes that a genuine popular uprising is unlikely at the time and arranges for a broadcast to warn Cuban patriots about potential provocations.",
